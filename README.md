# life-elisp-smalltalk-metaprogramming

A simple experiment to play with the interoperability at the meta level between Lisp (Emacs Lisp dialect) and Smalltalk (Pharo Smalltalk).

The experiment consists on the classic John Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton running on Lisp, but with the twist to build a metaprogram based on Smalltalk to be used as an alternative view of the game's status.
